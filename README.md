# CPPND: Capstone Tic Tac Toe Project

This is the Capstone Project for the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213).

The Capstone Project gives you a chance to integrate what you've learned throughout this program. This project will become an important part of your portfolio to share with current and future colleagues and employers.

This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe Game that uses the SMFL Library.
